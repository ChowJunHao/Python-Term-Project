# Interactive Periodic Table

An interactive periodic table application built using Python and Tkinter. This tool provides a visual representation of the periodic table and allows users to view detailed information about each element. It includes features such as search functionality, a pop-up details window, and filtering of element properties.

## Features

1. **Visual Periodic Table**
   - Displays all 118 elements with their symbols and atomic numbers.
   - Elements are color-coded based on their category (e.g., Non-metal, Alkali Metal).

2. **Element Details**
   - Hover over an element to view a tooltip with selected properties.
   - Click on an element to open a pop-up window displaying detailed information in a tabular format.

3. **Search Functionality**
   - Search for elements by name, symbol, or atomic number.
   - Displays search results in a scrollable window for quick navigation.

4. **Property Filtering**
   - Customize which properties are displayed in tooltips by selecting them from a scrollable list.

5. **Superscript Atomic Numbers**
   - Element symbols are displayed with their atomic numbers as superscripts.

6. **Scrollable and Neat Layout**
   - Scrollbars ensure usability even with large amounts of content.
   - Labels and frames organize the layout for better visual clarity.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries (Tkinter is included with Python by default).
3. Download the script files `Interactive Periodic Table.py` and `Data.py`.
4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python "Interactive Periodic Table.py"
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application by running the Python script.
2. Hover over elements to view their selected properties.
3. Click on elements to view detailed information in a pop-up window.
4. Use the search bar to locate specific elements by name, symbol, or atomic number.
5. Customize the properties displayed in the tooltip by selecting them from the scrollable list on the left panel.

## Development Notes

This project was created as a term project to provide a convenient and interactive way to access detailed information about chemical elements. Below is the development process:

1. Used ChatGPT to collect and organize data for all 118 elements.
2. Converted the data into a Python dictionary and saved it in `Data.py`.
3. Developed the interactive table with various functionalities using Tkinter.
4. Enhanced the application with pop-ups, tooltips, superscripts, and color-coded categories.
